# Spamming-your-friends
We are going to create a simple bot that will repeatly send (a message of your choice) for (your choice) amount of time to one of your friends on a texting app or website (facebook, twitter, wechat, instagram, etc).
# How to use
After you run the program, you need to navigate immediately to the place which you want the text to be sent (facebook, twitter, wechat, instagram, etc) and hover the curser right above the text box. After 1 second (Default), you should be able to see the message you want being inputed and sent. 
# Problem
If you navigate to a place where it can take inputs from the user (search bar, notepad, etc) after you have run the program, the program will start to input the message in that field and we don't want that.
# Solution
If you encounter any problem, end the program and redo.
